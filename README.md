# ArtHub

ArtHub is a Flask-based platform enabling users to buy and sell art, as well as share feedback. Artists showcase their creations for sale, while buyers browse and purchase directly through the site. The platform fosters a community where users can post reviews and share their experiences with art transactions. ArtHub aims to connect artists with art enthusiasts, providing a seamless marketplace for discovering and acquiring artworks. With its user-friendly interface and emphasis on user feedback, ArtHub supports both the commercial aspect of art sales and the cultural exchange that surrounds artistic expression and appreciation.
